This project was developed as part of the Intro to cybersecurity course at the University of Klagenfurt. The focus is on implementing and demonstrating Yao's Garbled Circuit Protocol for secure two-party computations. The chosen application is a secure computation of the sum between two parties, Alice and Bob, while preserving the confidentiality of their individual inputs.

By leveraging secure computation principles, this project highlights how cryptographic protocols can enable collaborative computations without exposing sensitive data, with potential real-world applications in privacy-critical domains like healthcare .

Cybersecurity-project.zip:
Contains the full implementation of the secure computation using Yao's protocol.
Includes all source code files, such as main.py, circuit/add.json, and other supporting scripts for running the protocol.
Cross-platform Python code for easy execution and testing.

write up project.pdf:
A detailed report focused on the Social, Ethical, and Legal (SEL) aspects of secure computation systems.
Discusses the implications of Yao's protocol in real-world scenarios, especially in healthcare.
